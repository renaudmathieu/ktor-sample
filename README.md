> Live-coding a web server with Ktor

**Ktor** is a **Kotlin** framework dedicated to building asynchronous servers and clients in connected systems. In this session, I will explain and demo the core concepts of Ktor 2 by live coding an HTTP server from scratch using Ktor Server. Also, we'll take an overview of Ktor Client, from setting it up to making requests and installing plugins.

## Getting Started

The purpose of this live session will be to send a POST request with a list of names to our web server and our web server will send a random value from this list. Itâ€™s a very simple call but it covers a lot of things from Ktor.
